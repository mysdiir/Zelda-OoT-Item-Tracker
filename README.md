>**Example**: When you get Goron Tunic at the location of Kokiri sword, right click on Kokiri Sword 
to give yourself an overview which item you have already checked.

> **Note**: *If keysanity is activated, due to lack of enough space within the application, tracking the origin 
> spot of dungeon keys is currently not possible.*

<br>

### Song storage:
> You also can store your chosen scarescrow song (the same as Horror Kid minigame) by `typing` your combination in the given text field.

> Your text will be shown until you delete it or close the application

> **Note**: *Saving and loading your current progress isn't implemented yet, so make sure you save your progress for your

### Grotto tracker:

> You can track your progress with visiting grottos by clicking the specific checkbox within the grotto panel.

<br>

### Triforce Hunt:

> In case you activated the Trifoce hunt in the randomizer settings, you can set your chosen value for the number of Triforce pieces you want to find.
Click `add` to add your value to the tracker.


> **Note**: During the next days / weeks I will add more detailed information like pictures to the readme file, or I will reorganize the information structure within this repository.
Also I will change the readability of the information files.
