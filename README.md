>**Example**: When you get Goron Tunic at the location of Kokiri sword, right click on Kokiri Sword 
to give yourself an overview which item you have already checked.

> **Note**: If keysanity is activated, due to lack of enough space within the application, tracking the origin spot of dungeon keys is currently not possible.
