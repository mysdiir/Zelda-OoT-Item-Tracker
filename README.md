# Zelda-OoT-Item-Tracker

<br>
This Zelda Ocarina of Time Item tracker is made for playing Zelda Ocarina of Time randomizer games and track the randomized items.
<br>

## Quick Guide:

### Item tracking:         
> Track your current recieved item with `left clicking` on the specific icon to the item.

<br>
                  
### Tracking originial position:
> To track the original position of vanilla item, use `right click`.

>**Example**: When you get Goron Tunic at the location of Kokiri sword, right click on Kokiri Sword 
to give yourself an overview which item you have already checked.

> **Note**: If keysanity is activated, due to lack of enough space within the application, tracking the origin spot of dungeon keys is currently not possible.

<br>

### Song storage:
> You also can store your chosen scarescrow song (the same as Horror Kid minigame) by `typing` your combination in the given text field.

<br>
        
### Grotto tracker:

> You can track your progress with visiting grottos by clicking the specific checkbox within the grotto panel.

<br>

### Triforce Hunt:

> In case you activated the Trifoce hunt in the randomizer settings, you can set your chosen value for the number of Triforce pieces you want to find.
Click `add` to add your value to the tracker.


> **Note**: During the next days / weeks I will add more detailed information like pictures to the readme file, or I will reorganize the information structure within this repository.
Also I will change the readability of the information files.
